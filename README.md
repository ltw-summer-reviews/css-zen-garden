## Details

- Approx. completion time: **3 hours**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, images**

CSS Zen Garden is an online project to show off the amazing capabilities of CSS. It’s been around since 2003 to serve, initially, as a way to encourage people to use CSS.

For this assignment concentrate on making a small screen layout for CSS Zen Garden.

- The design is completely up to you—do whatever you want.
- You cannot change the HTML—only adjust the CSS.
- Concentrate only on small screens, though the activity is meant for responsive, all screen websites. (We’re covering that in the fall term.)

*You don’t have to submit your design to the website—it’s just a fun exercise.*
